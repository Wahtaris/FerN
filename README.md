# field_indices.ipynb: This Python notebook is focused on visualizing various vegetation indices, specifically NDVI, NDRE, and EVI, over time using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The indices are vital for assessing the health and growth patterns of agricultural crops. This visualization helps in understanding the temporal changes in crop conditions and the effectiveness of agricultural practices.
# create_map.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook is a comprehensive tool for visualizing and analyzing agricultural parcels. It focuses on displaying the variations in fertilization treatments across parcels using advanced geospatial data processing techniques. The notebook generates interactive maps that are not only insightful but also user-friendly, with outputs available in HTML and PNG formats.
# indecies_plots.ipynb: This notebook presents a detailed analysis of vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The indices, including NDVI, NDRE, and EVI, are crucial for monitoring the health and growth of crops over time within specific agricultural parcels.
